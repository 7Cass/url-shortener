# `pnpm-lock.yaml` Documentation

## Overview

The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is an auto-generated lock file used by the `pnpm` package manager. It ensures consistent dependency installations across various environments by capturing the exact versions of dependencies and their transitive dependencies.

## File Structure

- **lockfileVersion**: Indicates the version of the lock file format.
- **settings**: Configuration options for dependency installation.
  - `autoInstallPeers`: Automatically install peer dependencies.
  - `excludeLinksFromLockfile`: Exclude symbolic links from the lock file.
- **dependencies**: Specifications and resolved versions of direct project dependencies.
- **devDependencies**: Specifications and resolved versions of development dependencies.
- **packages**: Detailed information about each installed package, including resolution details, engines compatibility, dependencies, and whether it is a development dependency.

## Detailed Sections

### `lockfileVersion`
```yaml
lockfileVersion: '6.0'
```
Specifies the version of the pnpm lock file format.

### `settings`
```yaml
settings:
  autoInstallPeers: true
  excludeLinksFromLockfile: false
```
Configuration settings:
- **autoInstallPeers**: Automatically installs peer dependencies.
- **excludeLinksFromLockfile**: If set to `true`, symbolic links are not included in the lock file.

### `dependencies`
The main dependencies required by the project with their version resolutions.
```yaml
dependencies:
  dotenv:
    specifier: ^16.4.5
    version: 16.4.5
  drizzle-orm:
    specifier: ^0.32.1
    version: 0.32.1(postgres@3.4.4)
  express:
    specifier: ^4.19.2
    version: 4.19.2
  express-rate-limit:
    specifier: ^7.4.0
    version: 7.4.0(express@4.19.2)
  helmet:
    specifier: ^7.1.0
    version: 7.1.0
  postgres:
    specifier: ^3.4.4
    version: 3.4.4
```
Each dependency entry includes:
- **specifier**: The semantic versioning range from `package.json`.
- **version**: The exact version resolved and installed.

### `devDependencies`
The development dependencies required by the project.
```yaml
devDependencies:
  '@types/express':
    specifier: ^4.17.21
    version: 4.17.21
  '@types/node':
    specifier: ^20.14.12
    version: 20.14.12
  drizzle-kit:
    specifier: ^0.23.0
    version: 0.23.0
  ts-node-dev:
    specifier: ^2.0.0
    version: 2.0.0(@types/node@20.14.12)(typescript@5.5.4)
  typescript:
    specifier: ^5.5.4
    version: 5.5.4
```
Each devDependency entry includes:
- **specifier**: The semantic versioning range from `package.json`.
- **version**: The exact version resolved and installed.

### `packages`
A detailed breakdown of resolved packages, including their integrity hash, dependencies, and whether they are only used for development (`dev: true`).

Example:
```yaml
  /@cspotcode/source-map-support@0.8.1:
    resolution: {integrity: sha512-IchNf6dN4tHoMFIn/7OE8LWZ19Y6q/67Bmf6vnGREv8RSbBVb9LPJxEcnwrcwX6ixSvaiGoomAUvu4YSxXrVgw==}
    engines: {node: '>=12'}
    dependencies:
      '@jridgewell/trace-mapping': 0.3.9
    dev: true
```
Each package entry includes:
- **resolution**: Integrity hash for ensuring the package contents are tamper-free.
- **engines**: Node.js version compatibility.
- **dependencies**: Other packages required by this package.
- **dev**: Indicates if it's a development-only dependency.

## Conclusion

The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is critical for maintaining consistent environments by locking down the specific versions of all packages and their dependencies. This ensures that the project builds and runs the same across different installations, preventing bugs caused by version mismatches.
